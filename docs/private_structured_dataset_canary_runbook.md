# Private Real-Tool Structured Dataset Canary runbook

This runbook freezes the private BR1 path. It does not claim that a private run has occurred.

## Preconditions

Use a trusted private Molly deployment with server-owned configured resource authority for one Uni-Mol training profile and one REINVENT4 generation profile. Do not place endpoints, hostnames, paths, accounts, SSH arguments, credentials, commands, stdout/stderr or raw exceptions in repository files or public evidence.

Confirm that the private dataset satisfies molecule/InChIKey grouping, paper grouping, an independent/external holdout, deduplicated training size and measurement-condition retention. If TADF sufficiency is not demonstrated, set the scope to broader organic emitter PLQY and do not call outputs TADF candidates.

## Procedure

1. Deploy the reviewed repository commit and the matching `molly-worker` package. Confirm the server registry is exactly `br1-private-real-tool-v3` and the Uni-Mol execution profile is exactly `unimol-train-br1-v2`.
2. In the actual configured Uni-Mol Python environment, run the operator-side applicability preflight against the exact Raw CSV, `source_dataset_manifest.v1`, and `br1_raw_dataset_mapping_policy.v1`. The command accepts private paths only; publish the complete report privately and export only the summary:

   ```bash
   python scripts/run_br1_unimol_applicability_preflight.py \
     --raw-dataset <private-path> \
     --source-manifest <private-path> \
     --mapping-policy <private-path> \
     --output-report <private-path> \
     --public-summary <private-path> \
     --expected-provider-version <reviewed-unimol-tools-version>
   ```

   Pass the reviewed commit through `--repository-commit` or the private
   `MOLLY_REPOSITORY_COMMIT` environment variable when the installed worker is
   not inside a Git checkout. The expected provider version must come from the
   reviewed worker/capability authority and is exact-compared with the
   installed provider version; omitting it is `BLOCKED` with
   `PROVIDER_VERSION_AUTHORITY_UNAVAILABLE`. Do not put that value, provider
   paths, or probe output in public evidence. The preflight never calls a
   training method; if the installed provider has no explicitly documented
   read-only preprocessing API, the result must be `BLOCKED` with
   `PROVIDER_PREFLIGHT_API_UNAVAILABLE`.
3. If the summary is `PASS`, freeze the final Raw CSV, source manifest and mapping policy bytes and run Raw Dataset inspection and review snapshot creation through the Molly project/run.
4. Before presenting or accepting the Gate, re-read the exact Registry-bound Raw CSV and deterministically rebuild the v2 review. Require exact equality for molecule identity, normalized condition, observed payload, source context, observation/conflict grouping, duplicate/conflict findings, reason codes, actions and confirmed/excluded rosters; nested digest self-consistency alone is insufficient. Then have a trusted human approve that exact snapshot and verify that the shared GateDecision and receipt bind the current project, run, raw/review digests, row rosters, target, role and condition policy.
5. If the summary is `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, stop and submit only the counts and reason summary to the owner for an explicit exclusion decision. Do not silently project or delete unsupported rows.
6. If the summary is `BLOCKED`, fix the provider/environment authority or revise the data scope. Do not start an acceptance run.
7. Publish the Confirmed Dataset from that receipt. Raw CSV is not training authority.
8. Prepare `structured_dataset_private_real_tool_request.v1` with logical profile IDs and public provider/version/config digests only. The request requires fresh Uni-Mol and real REINVENT4 and rejects old model, prediction, candidate roster and `existing_output`.
9. Submit the request through existing Permission evaluation, immutable authorization and approve-and-start. Dispatch only through Harness Controller, `RemoteExecutionService` and `molly-worker`.
10. Require completion receipt + Registry binding + verified publication before consuming the current model package. A checkpoint or `StageState SUCCEEDED` alone is insufficient.
11. Dispatch REINVENT4 once. If the outcome is unknown, stop in recovery-required and reconcile the exact dispatch; do not dispatch again.
12. Predict with the current model/current roster, rank with the frozen config, validate chemistry and publish `Computational Top-N`.
13. Restart the process and exact-replay reads. Confirm no second training or generation dispatch occurred.
14. Read the same run through `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/agent-runs/{run_id}/inspection` and correlate Molly with OTel and actual LLM calls in LangSmith. No extra LLM call is required for BR1.

## Evidence review

Private evidence adds Uni-Mol provider/version, verified training publication, REINVENT4 version/config digest, execution classification, generation/prediction/ranking bindings, OTel correlation and LangSmith correlation only where an LLM was actually invoked. Export only privacy-redacted digests, status classes and safe IDs.

Do not mark `M3H-013 I/T/V / DONE` until fresh Uni-Mol, real REINVENT4, current-run prediction/ranking/validation, restart/replay evidence and repository-owner exact-HEAD review all exist. BR1 alone never closes M3H-GATE-006, M3.5 or Molly v1.

## 2026-08-03 preflight result

The first post-merge private preflight failed closed before an acceptance ID or
run was created. The repository-owned Uni-Mol and REINVENT4 logical profiles
had current available capability probes, but the server-owned remote resource
authority policy was not configured. The supplied source CSV also required an
authoritative BR1 Raw Dataset mapping because it did not contain the required
contract columns as-is.

The uploaded source also lacked dataset name/version, source URL, license and
download date. Those values remain unknown and are recorded as
`SOURCE_PROVENANCE_MISSING`. In the numeric-QY subset, repeated chromophores
across solvent conditions conflict with an InChIKey-only duplicate exclusion;
this is recorded as `CONDITION_AWARE_IDENTITY_POLICY_UNRESOLVED`. Do not map
that subset into BR1 Raw Dataset rows until source provenance, field mapping and
the condition-aware identity policy are authoritative.

No Controller execution, confirmation, training, generation, restart or replay
was attempted. The privacy-safe finding is recorded in
`docs/evidence/br1-private-real-tool-canary-v1/`. After both blockers are
resolved, use a new clean acceptance ID and run ID; do not amend this blocked
preflight into a successful acceptance.

## Applicability preflight handoff

This preflight is operator evidence before acceptance, not a second runtime
authority. A development-branch real-environment run can only be called a
smoke test. After this PR is merged, repeat the preflight on the reviewed
commit with the matching worker before freezing data or creating an acceptance
ID/run ID.

- `PASS`: freeze the final Raw CSV, source manifest and mapping policy, then create a new clean BR1 acceptance.
- `REVIEW_REQUIRED`: provide counts and reason summary to the owner and wait for an explicit exclusion decision.
- `BLOCKED`: repair provider/environment authority or select a supported data range; do not start acceptance.

## Development-branch evidence boundary

Real applicability preflight: `NOT EXECUTED`. The development environment has
not produced an authoritative private applicability report. The default
discovery path is only expected to return `BLOCKED` with
`PROVIDER_PREFLIGHT_API_UNAVAILABLE` until a matching environment exposes the
versioned read-only provider API; that expectation is not a real-environment
preflight result.
